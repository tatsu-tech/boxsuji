## Afterword
This is the game I came up with when I was in junior high school student.  
I created a lot of questions and had my friends solve them.  
I still remember being glad to see my worried friends.  
I know it is interesting not only to solve questions, but also to create the question yourself, so I created this game to share this fun.  
If you find it a little fun, please play !  
This game is the first app to create on my own.  
I am still studying including English, so I think there are a lot of strange descriptions.  
I'm glad if you can condone.
